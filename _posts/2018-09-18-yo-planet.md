This site is under development.
Of course it is. 
It will probably stay like this forever.

Well, maybe not forever. Until Jekyll changes and I don't update the code, or I stop using GitHub because [Microsoft ruins it](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/technology/microsoft-github-cloud-computing.html).

Of course I didn't spend 13 minutes forking a repo and editing the `_config.yml` file for _nothing_. I hope to share updates on projects here, if only for prospective employers (hi there). I have irons in the fire like everybody else on the internet, but I've got to actually do something on them before I post here. 

If I get into blogging. 

We'll see.
