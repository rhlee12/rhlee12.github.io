## Operation Popeye

Last year, while poking around with the excellent (metScanR)[https://jaroberti.github.io/metScanR/] R package, I ended up finding sites in Vietnam that apparently collected snow data:

Digging into the station metadata showed that the stations were only active from 1960-1972, durring the Vietnam War, and were only stationed in the south of the country. Clearly these were US military met stations.

On the surface, this all seems unremarkable. Afterall, planning any military action requires at least some consideration of the weather conditions. The US military during the Vietnam War was notably reliant on aircraft, which further explains the US's need for met stations durring the war.
