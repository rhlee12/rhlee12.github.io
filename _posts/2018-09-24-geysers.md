Last week the Upper Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park (home to Old Faithful) [experienced some changes](https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/yellowstone/article_home.html). In reading up on the perturbation, I was wondering where each of the affected geysers was, which reminded me of a project I had a few years ago.

Durring some free time a few years ago, I compiled all the geysers listed in the excellent book _Geysers of Yellowstone, Fourth Edition_, by T. Scott Bryan into one Google map. Initially developed for the [Geyser Observation and Study Association](http://www.geyserstudy.org/), I am now hosting the map and source KMZ here for anyone interested.
